  The period of the Renaissance and Reformation was also the time when Europeans were coming to increase contact with people of darker pigmentation(coloring, especially of skin) in Africa and Asia.
 The reason for enslaving Africans was beacuse they were pagan. Slave traders and slave owners sometimes interpreted a passage in the book of Genesis for their justification.
  When Virginia decreed in 1667 that converted slaves could be kept in serfdom the justification for black servitude was then  changed from religious status to something approaching race. 
  This was now the beggining of racism.

  Slaves where treated terribly. Whippings, executions, and rapes was a common thing for them.
 There were 1,161 slaves executed in the U.S. between the 1790s and 1850s.
