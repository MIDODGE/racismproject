 The period of the Renaissance and Reformation was also the time when Europeans were coming to increase contact with people of darker pigmentation(coloring, especially of skin) in Africa and Asia.
 The reason for enslaving Africans was beacuse they were pagan. Slave traders and slave owners sometimes interpreted a passage in the book of Genesis for their justification.
